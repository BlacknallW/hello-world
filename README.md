Tutorial into using GitHub

Hello, Github.

My name is William Blacknall and I am career changing into the world of technology and development. Prior to this career change, I was a middle school teacher, certified in Math and Science. I have 4 years of teaching experience, and while I do miss interacting with my students, technology has always been something that greatly interested me.

I also enjoy cooking.
